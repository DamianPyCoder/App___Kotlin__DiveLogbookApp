<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started.

I have provided an APK inside the repository. If you have a problem, you can generate it with android studio using the project files.
You need to download this APK file on your smartphone, tap on it and accept the unknown sources.



### APK.
If you cannot use or download the APK, you can generate one from Android Studio with the next route.
  ```sh
  Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)
  ```


### Login.
The implemented login is a beta version that offers low security since the password and username can be seen in the code. The final project has a working login with a database in Firebase. But I have this part hosted in a private repository.


  ```sh
  User:      admin
  Password:  admin
  ```

## Acknowledgments.
I want to express my gratitude to my teacher Marta Mill√°n, for having discovered a new world for me, that of creating mobile applications. I still don't know whether to focus my professional career in this direction, but thanks of this experience of course now it is a very plausible option.

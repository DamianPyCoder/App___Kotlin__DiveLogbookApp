# APP WHALE SHARK (logbook)
<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project.

The first time I build a mobile app, the theme has been a diving logbook that implements differents tools from a weather forecasts with an API to statistical calculations and recommendations to progress as a diver.

I have not attached all the code, some parts are in a private repository. I firmly believe that developers should support and help each other, but throughout my short career I have seen many people who simply copied and pasted without stopping to understand how the program worked, what logic was implemented by the person who developed the application. For this reason, I consider that if someone wants to see the rest of the code or has questions about what i show, it is more appropriate for them to contact me so that I can help them.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started.

I have provided an APK inside the repository. If you have a problem, you can generate it with android studio using the project files.
You need to download this APK file on your smartphone, tap on it and accept the unknown sources.



### APK.
If you cannot use or download the APK, you can generate one from Android Studio with the next route.
  ```sh
  Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)
  ```


### Login.
The implemented login is a beta version that offers low security since the password and username can be seen in the code. The final project has a working login with a database in Firebase. But I have this part hosted in a private repository.


  ```sh
  User: admin
  Password: admin
  ```

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
## Acknowledgments.
I want to express my gratitude to my teacher Marta Mill√°n, for having discovered a new world for me, that of creating mobile applications. I still don't know whether to focus my professional career in this direction, but thanks of this experience of course now it is a very plausible option.
